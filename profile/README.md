# Real P2P Marketplaces

## Introduction
Amazon takes up to 20% commission on your purchases. Booking.com: 15 to 20%, Ebay: 10-15%, AirBnB: 10-20%, Fiverr 20%...  

The question now is: does the service that these platforms provide is worth this amount of commission?

Classical economic theory, relying on free competition, will answer "yes, otherwise they would have competitors and prices would go down". 
Except that all these companies ("marketplaces") have a quasi-monopolistic situation, and can impose the conditions they want to sellers and buyers. 
In fact, marketplaces very often tend to become monopolies because of the "network effect" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect).  

But when you think about it, these sites generally do not do much more than providing a website to connect people. 
The commissions they take therefore appear to be largely unreasonable. The open source community can do something about this.  

These sites that are being called "P2P Marketplaces" must give way to **real peer-to-peer marketplaces**!  

## What we do
*Real P2P Marketplaces* (RP2PM) has several projects for truly decentralised marketplaces, designed to replace the well-known competitors: Amazon, Ebay, Airbnb, Fiverr, ...  

Unlike the hundreds of companies that have tried (unsuccessfully) to attack the monopoly of these giants, we have a chance to succeed, because we offer something that none of them could promise to their users:
a 100% free, commission-free, ad-free platform.  
Our ambition is to create a platform whose code is *open source*, hosted in a decentralised way, and using a decentralised database.  

## Contribute to the project
Like any *open source* project, we rely heavily on community contributions.
